# Expense_tracker

- This is a React JS app. It is a product of the [highly-rated full react course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wby3@AL6jvz7avmmgWW50Kxn5N0dQzKTsUJ4h9tNtC8od8-bVWvd8HjavtwjX_bg8kgjX/) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy.

- The app lets you track your yearly, daily and monthly expenditure through charts that visualize expense data

- Building the app allows me learn the following:
    * All the core basics: How React works, building components with React & building UIs with React
    * Components, props & dynamic data binding. Functional components, class components
    * Working with user events and state to create interactive applications
    * How React works under the hood
    * How to work with lists and conditional content
